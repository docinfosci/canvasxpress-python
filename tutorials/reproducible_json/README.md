# Reproducible JSONs

CanvasXpress provides the ability to save chart configurations as JSON files 
that contain all of the information necessary to established a copy of the 
chart, its data, and various other attributes.

These JSON files were extracted from the examples available at the 
[CanvasXpress Examples Section](https://www.canvasxpress.org/examples/bar-1.html)
on July 5, 2021.  They can be used to explore a multitude of chart configurations
using the CanvasXpress for Python `CanvasXpress.from_reproducible_json()`
function.

These files are also used to generate the Jupyter Notebook and standard Python
examples contained elsewhere in the tutorials directory for this project.
