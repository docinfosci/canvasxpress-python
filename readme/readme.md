## About this Package

***This package is recently released for general use.  We maintain thorough code coverage and use the package ourselves,
but it remains possible that edge use cases can be refined.  We appreciate your feedback and patience.***

***CanvasXpress*** was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis
at Bristol-Myers Squibb. It supports a large number of [visualizations ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/examples.html) 
to display scientific and non-scientific data. ***CanvasXpress*** also includes a simple and unobtrusive
[user interface](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/interface.html) to explore complex data sets, a sophisticated and
unique mechanism to keep track of all user customization for
[Reproducible Research ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/audit.html) purposes, as well as an 'out of the box'
broadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points in all ***CanvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can
be easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events
as well as the zooming, panning and drag-and-drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its
class.

***CanvasXpress*** can be now be used within Python for native integration into
IPython and Web environments, such as;
or seamlessly embedded in applications, such as:
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Complete examples of the ***CanvasXpress*** library including the mouse events, zooming, 
and broadcasting capabilities are included in this package.  This ***CanvasXpress*** Python 
package was created by Dr. Todd C. Brett, with support from 
[Aggregate Genius Inc.](https://www.aggregate-genius.com), in cooperation with the ***CanvasXpress*** team.

The maintainer of the Python edition of this package is [Dr. Todd C. Brett](https://github.com/docinfosci).
