## About this Package

***canvasXpress*** was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis
at Bristol-Myers Squibb. It supports a large number of [visualizations ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/examples.html) 
to display scientific and non-scientific data. ***canvasXpress*** also includes a simple and unobtrusive
[user interface](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/interface.html) to explore complex data sets, a sophisticated and
unique mechanism to keep track of all user customization for
[Reproducible Research ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/audit.html) purposes, as well as an 'out of the box'
broadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points in all ***canvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can
be easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events
as well as the zooming, panning and drag-and-drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its
class.

***canvasXpress*** can be now simply used within Python at the console to generate conventional plots; in an IDE;
or seamlessly embedded in applications, such as:

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Full-fledged examples of the ***canvasXpress*** library including the mouse events, zooming, and broadcasting
capabilities are included in this package in several examples.  This ***canvasXpress*** Python package was
created by [Aggregate Genius Inc.](https://www.aggregate-genius.com) in cooperation with the ***canvasXpress***
team.

The maintainer of the Python edition of this package is [Dr. Todd C. Brett](https://github.com/docinfosci).
